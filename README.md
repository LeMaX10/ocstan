- Supports most of [Laravel](https://laravel.com)'s **beautiful magic**
- Supports most of [OctoberCMS](https://octobercms.com)'s **beautiful magic**

## ‚ú® Getting Started In 3 Steps

> **Requires:**
- **[PHP 7.2+](https://php.net/releases/)**
- **[Laravel 6.0+](https://github.com/laravel/laravel)**

**1**: First, you may use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to install Larastan as a development dependency into your Laravel project:
```bash
composer require --dev lemax10/ocstan
```

> Using Larastan for analysing Laravel packages? You may need to install `orchestra/testbench`.

**2**: Then, create a `phpstan.neon` or `phpstan.neon.dist` file in the root of your application. It might look like this:

```
includes:
    - ./vendor/lemax10/ocstan/extension.neon

parameters:

    paths:
        - app

    # The level 8 is the highest level
    level: 4

    ignoreErrors:
        - '#Unsafe usage of new static#'

    excludePaths:
        - ./*/*/FileToBeExcluded.php

    checkMissingIterableValueType: false
```

For all available options, please take a look at the PHPStan documentation: **https://phpstan.org/config-reference**

**3**: Finally, you may start analyzing your code using the phpstan console command:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
```

If you are getting the error `Allowed memory size exhausted`, then you can use the `--memory-limit` option fix the problem:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=2G
```
